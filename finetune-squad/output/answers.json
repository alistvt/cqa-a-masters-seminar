preparation of children for adult roles. it is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another. puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. it is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics ( for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls ) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. this is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. the male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development ; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. the testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. the production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. some boys may develop
