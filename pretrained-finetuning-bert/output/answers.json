taking pictures because they think that it helps record the moment, but as henkel's latest study has just found out, this obsession may prevent their brains from remembering what actually happened, reported the guardian. in her study, henkel led a group of college students around a museum and asked them to simply observe 15 objects and to photograph 15 others. the next day the students'memory of the tour was tested, and the results showed that they were less accurate in recognizing the objects and they remembered fewer details about them if they photographed them. \" when people rely on technology to remember for them - counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences, \" henkel explained. but there is also an exception : if students zoomed in to photograph part of an object, their memory actually improved, and those who focused the lens on a specific area could even recall parts that weren't in the frame. so basically, this study is saying that constantly taking pictures can harm your memory. but shouldn't reviewing pictures we have taken help

- image ( one's mental model of oneself ), self - esteem, and individuality. consequently, weinreich gives the definition \" a person's identity is defined as the totality of one's self - construal, in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future \" ; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as : \" one's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self - construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity \" ( weinreich, 1986a ). the description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where \" identity \" needs to be mapped and defined. how should one describe the identity of another, in ways which encompass both their idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications, both of which can shift according to circumstance? following on from the work of kelly, erikson, tajfel and others weinreich's identity structure analysis ( isa ), is \" a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time \u2026 with the emphasis on the socio - cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions \" ( weinreich and saunderson, ( eds ) 2003, p1 ). using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms, the practical operationalisation of isa provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual, applied across time and milieus by the \" situated self \" to appraise self and other agents and institutions ( for example, resulting in the individual's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions"}, {"id": "3u84xhcdicdb6vqtlfud7syhj444z2", "turn_id": 11, "answer": "[ citation needed ]"}, {"id": "3ns0a6kxc48ribjdggweghvk99agzy",
